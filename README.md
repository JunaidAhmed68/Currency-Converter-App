# Currency Converter

A React-based currency converter app that lets users convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates from the [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).

## Features

- Select "From" and "To" currencies from a comprehensive dropdown list.
- Input any amount to convert.
- Swap the "From" and "To" currencies instantly.
- Mark currencies as favorites for quick access (favorites are saved in `localStorage`).
- Fetches up-to-date exchange rates dynamically.
- Responsive and animated UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- Uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management.
